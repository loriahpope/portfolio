        The Employee Vacation Tracker allows employees to request time off through a simple interface, as well as view the time off of their team.
    </p>
    <p class="subtitle-details">
        I was the lead designer on this project. In addition to completing a heuristic review of the existing request system, I interviewed many users of the current site to understand their pain points and difficulties in preparation for designing the new tracker.
    </p>
    <p class="subtitle-details nda-text">
        Due to my non-disclosure agreement, I will not be sharing actual images of the site as it was. Rather, all opinions and words are my own, and all prototypes are my own based on the original.

        <h2 class="h2-details col-12">1| Heuristic Evaluation of Existing Site </h2>

        <h3 class="h3-details col-12">Initial Setup</h3>
        <p class="col-12 details-text">
            The initial setup information seems like something we should already know about the user and allow them to confirm or update during setup. Furthermore, many employees may not know how many carryover days they have immediately.
        </p>
        <p class="col-12 details-text">
            For a global corporation, the list of work locations to select from is sparse and confusing. Certain items, such as 'State of Massachusetts' is not uniform with the city, state format, and 'San Francisco, CA' and 'California - not including San Francisco' is confusing as well.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h3-details col-12">Home</h3>
        <p class="col-12 details-text">
            I could change how the user information is displayed so there are more logical groupings of information.
            <ul class="details-text">
                <li>Name, Employee ID, Location</li>
                <li>Employee Status, FSLA Status, Standard Hours, Standard Hours Effective Date</li>
                <li>Time Record End Date, Time Record Begin Date, Pay Cut Off Time</li>
                <li>Unclear is this information is necessary for an average full-time employee</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="col-12 details-text">
            It is also confusing to have a message stating that you cannot use the system as an exempt employee.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h3-details col-12">My Attendance</h3>
        <p class="col-12 details-text">
            It would be nice to see employee request information in a more visual representation. The status of my pending request and teh new/edit request screen should be more noticeable than my employee information on this screen.
        </p>
        <h3 class="h3-details col-12">Save Request</h3>
        <p class="col-12 details-text">
            I expect to see "Submit" as an option within the confirmation modal, rather than 'Confirm' and 'Reject' with the same visual treatment.
        </p>
        <h3 class="h3-details col-12">Error Screen</h3>
        <p class="col-12 details-text">
            The error message is not entirely obvious on the page.
        </p>
        <h3 class="h3-details col-12">Success/Confirmation Screen</h3>
        <p class="col-12 details-text">
            The vacation code is not commonly understood by everyone. This should be listed in full text.
        <p class="col-12 details-text">
            There is not a lot of visual feedback on the screen to indicate that the request status changed
        </p>
        <p class="col-12 details-text">
            Cancelled requests should be removed from the approvals list.
        </p>
        <p class="col-12 details-text">
            Should last modified time/by be combined? Unless the user is able to sort, this may not be necessary. How are these columns used? If I am unable to edit requests, these columns will never update.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h3-details col-12">New Request</h3>
        <p class="col-12 details-text">
            It would be nice to see a balance of vacation days as I am choosing the vacation code.
        </p>
        <p class="col-12 details-text">
            Does it make sense for the default code to be Bereavement? It would make more sense to default to "Vacation" or simply "Choose Time Off Type".
        </p>
        <h3 class="h3-details col-12">Vacation Balance</h3>
        <p class="col-12 details-text">
            This page is not easily scanned by the user. The two most important numbers the user cares about are how much vacation they have for the year, and how much they have left to use.
        </p>
        <h3 class="h3-details col-12">My History</h3>
        <p class="col-12 details-text">
            This page only shows how many days are available, but it would be nice to give the user some information about when they used those dates.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h3-details col-12">Time</h3>
        <p class="col-12 details-text">
            This entire screen is meant for non-exempt employees, however there is no indication of this on the screen.

        <h3 class="h3-details col-12">User Interviews</h3>
        <p class="col-12 details-text">
            I gathered the following candid feedback by utilizing our internal social networking site. Below is a compiled list of notes, quotes, and general findings from speaking with users of the system:
        </p>
        <ul class="details-text">
            <li>
                "I tried to request 8 days off, from a Wednesday to Friday of the following week. This should have been 8 days off. The form reported 10 days as the total number of days since it counted the weekend. This stopped me from submitting the request until I find out if that is how the calculation is done. It would be a poor design if I have to submit these as 2 separate requests if the system does not know about weekends.
            </li>
            <li>
                "There is no option for volunteer days."
            </li>
            <li>
                "There is no way a few hours off, only a half day."
            </li>
            <li>
                "Exempt employees should not see the Time or History tabs.  They should be brought directly to MyAttendance upon login."
            </li>
            <li>
                "Instead of showing unnecessary information like 'Holiday Schedule Election Date', 'Sensitive Position Certification Date', etc, on the Request Page, it should just show a uncluttered display of vacation balance."
            </li>
            <li>
                "Managers should be able to input absences on behalf of their employees."
            </li>
            <li>
                "When an employee enters a request, "To Date" should prepopulate with the same date as the "From Date".  They shouldn't have to select "To Date" for a single day absence."
            </li>
            <li>
                "There are so many different Vacation Codes, why are Service Recognition and Voluntary Time off in the same option? I don't see what they have to do with each other. Service Recognition is earned. I don't know what Voluntary Time off means.  Isn't ALL time off voluntary?"
            </li>
            <li>
                "Why can't an employee view the attendance of a peer to know if they are Out of Office?"
            </li>
            <li>
                "There is no view to see absence details of manager's entire team, just the allocated days"
            </li>
            <li>
                "Why is this only available for US employees?  Don't employees in other countries need a way to track attendance?"
            </li>
            <li>
                "What are some things you think work well about the current submission process?"
            </li>
            <li>
                "No way to sort or filter absence requests."

        <p class="col-12 details-text">
            After choosing the card model, I conducted users quick usability tests with users that had previously provided feedback. The following questions were asked:

            <li>Do you have direct reports? If so, how many?</li>

            After defining the user personas, the problem statements can be defined as follows:

            After listening to feedback from users, I drew out screen ideas for what the redesigned application could look like.

            <strong>Features</strong>
            <p>
                After iterating through possible views, I ultimately decided it would be best to go with a simple dashboard widget that users can add to their Intranet Home Page. The majority of the functionality a user needs does not need to be contained in a full site that may assume the user spends more time requesting vacation than they do. Requests can happen from a modal window, same for approvals. This way, the application is as simple as possible.
