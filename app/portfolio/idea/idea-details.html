        [Description]
    </p>
    <p class="subtitle-details">
        I was the lead designer on this project. In addition to completing a heuristic review of the existing portal, I interviewed many users of the current site to understand their pain points and difficulties in preperation for designing the new system.
    </p>
    <p class="subtitle-details nda-text">
        Due to my non-disclosure agreement, I will not be sharing actual screenshots of the site as it was. Rather, all opinions and words are my own, and all prototypes are my own based on the original.

        <h2 class="h2-details col-12">1| Heuristic Evaluation of Existing Site </h2>

        <h3 class="h3-details col-12">Homepage</h3>
        <p class="col-12 details-text">
            At first glance, there seems to be a lot of information on the page. There are a lot of bold, bright colors, which increase the difficulty of finding the correct task. There is navigation both on the top and left-side of the page, so I'm not sure where I should be looking to complete a task. If I wanted to submit an idea, I am not sure where I would actually do that.
        </p>
        <p class="col-12 details-text">
            The news page seems like it could be an important way to highlight information and resources that would encourage someone to submit an idea or encourage someone to learn more about ideas. I also like being able to see the active campaigns - this should be a larger focus on the page.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h3-details col-12">My Ideas Page</h3>
        <p class="col-12 details-text">
            This page is meant to show the user all of the ideas that they have submitted. It seems like a good opportunity to add a "Submit an Idea" button.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h3-details col-12">Recommendations</h3>
        <p class="col-12 details-text">
            This page is meant to show the user ideas that have been recommended to them. When I come to the page, my first question is why are these ideas recommended to me? It would also be nice to see a brief description of the ideas before being required to click into them.
        </p>
        <h3 class="h3-details col-12">Innovation News</h3>
        <p class="col-12 details-text">
            The News page seems like it would be beneficial if users were spending a lot of time looking for Innovation News when they come to the site. There is a lot of content here that could be better organized on another site.
        </p>
        <h3 class="h3-details col-12">Reviewers List</h3>
        <p class="col-12 details-text">
            This link is part of the Idea Review process that all idea submissions pass through. The load time was fairly slow, and there is not enough feedback for the user to know they should wait for a file to download after clicking the link.
        </p>
        <h3 class="h3-details col-12">Businesses</h3>
        <p class="col-12 details-text">
            This page is intended to teach idea submitters about the Lines of Businesses that they can submit their ideas to be a part of. This page seems essential, however the purpose is unclear upon first visit.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h3-details col-12">Metrics</h3>
        <p class="col-12 details-text">
            This page has a lot of useful information, and is interestingly the only page I can go to that allows me to view submitted ideas. There is also no scrollbar on the page, so I am unable to see the information that is 'below the fold'. There is also a legal disclaimer on the top of the page that is easy to miss because it has the same visual treatment as multiple alerts on the page.
        </p>
        <h3 class="h3-details col-12">Contact Us</h3>
        <p class="col-12 details-text">
            This tab opens up the same 'My Innovation Team' window that we have already seen before. If this information needs to be seen at all times, then we can centralize it within the application.
        </p>
        <h3 class="h3-details col-12">My Idea Portal</h3>
        <p class="col-12 details-text">
            The collaborative features of this portal can be moved to the internal social networking site to improve collaboration, participation, and visibility. For example, calendar events can be created in teh internal social networking site, which will allow people to actually register to the event.
        </p>
        <p class="col-12 details-text">
            It seems like the majority of the actual action is taken from this portal, which is only accessible through a small link on the main site. We can highlight the important actions from this new page in the portal.
        </p>
        <p class="col-12 details-text">
            There are a lot of options here for forms. We can make the form type simple enough to include the request type and description.
        </p>
        <p class="col-12 details-text">
            I understand the Businesses page to be incredibly important for teh user to know where they should submit their ideas. However, these two pages are two separated for the user to remember this information, We should include some helping information on the new design.
        </p>

        <p class="col-12 details-text">
            To get an understanding of the current user experience, I organized user interviews with a number of frequent users of the system ("Innovation Champions"), asking the following questions:

                What are your thoughts on the current process for tracking completion/execution of an idea?

        <h3 class="h3-details col-12">Understanding User Feedback</h3>
        <p class="col-12 details-text">
            Below is a compiled list of notes, quotes, and general findings from the user interviews:
        </p>
        <p class="col-12 details-text">
            <strong>Notes</strong>
        </p>
        <ul class="details-text">
            <li>
                How to encourage users to submit ideas beyond monetary incentives?
            </li>
            <li>
                Some submitters may not realize how much time it takes to submit ideas
            </li>
            <li>
                Some submitters have expressed discouragement after submitting ideas yet have never heard anything - they may not want to submit an idea again
            </li>
            <li>
                Approvers get emails when ideas are submitted - it is a fairly seamless process to approve ideas
            </li>
            <li>
                Users make extensive use of Campaigns, not so much JAMs through the system. Users are much more likely to meet biweekly to discuss innovation.
            </li>
            <li>
                Review current usage of the portal - initially people were submitting lots of ideas, but as teh portal grew, approvers couldn't support the influx of ideas, resulting in user frustration.
            </li>
        </ul>
